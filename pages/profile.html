            <p>Graduate with Diploma in Web Application Development, and currently pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in ACLC College of Tacloban. I grew up along with innovatinmg technology, and it influences me a lot.</p>

        <p>When I'm not coding, I immerse myself in music. I started playing guitar at 7 and got serious by 12. While I create covers and explore guitar fingerstyle, my focus has shifted recently. As a member of our church's worship team, I've also discovered skills in bass, drums, and keyboards, deepening my love for music.        </p>
